# Machine Learning using R Programming #
### Machine Learning with R studio using R Programming ###

#### The basic ML models such as Linear & Logistic regression and the advanced models such as Decision trees, SVM, XGBOOST, Forests etc. By the end of this course you will be able to confidently build predictive Machine Learning models to solve business problems as well as create business strategy. ####

Machine Learning with R studio explains how machine learning (ML) techniques can be used to solve business problems. Explaining the basics of statistics, machine learning and the R programming language. This will help you set up your system and also provide the prerequisites for building machine learning models. Then you will learn about the primary functions of machine learning and different terms associated with machine learning.

Next, you will learn about Linear Regression, which is the most popular machine learning model. You will be shown how to prepare data for the analysis and how to perform a univariate analysis and bi-variate analysis to analyze the quality of data available. Once the data is ready, you will learn how to build simple linear regression and multiple linear regression models. You will also be introduced to other advanced regression models such as Lasso and Ridge regression.

The last it will focus on advanced models of machine learning, including classification models such as logistic regression, KNN and LDA. You will also learn about decision trees and a specialized type of ML model called Support Vector Machines. By the end of this course, you should have a thorough understanding of how to use Machine Learning to create predictive models and solve business problems. So, why wait? Start the course today and build your confidence in creating ML models using R Studio in a few hours!
